# DualClockDisplay
Dual clock display is a simple application that prompts the user for the time and displays two clocks simultaneously (one 12 hour clock and one 24 hour clock). The user then has 4 choices which are to add one hour, add one minute, add one second, or exit the program. Throughout the time completeing this assignment, the things I did best were commenting my code very thoroughly as well as making sure it was structured properly. I could have definitely found some short hand commands for certain parts if I had spent more time on it. The hardest part for me was probably writing the functional methods that allows the user to do certain things. The reason this was hard was due to the fact that I was just starting out with C++ and did not know that in order for a method to be called it had to be above where the call is happening. The project not only allowed me to learn the syntax of C++, but also allowed me to refresh on some of the basic programming concepts. I made the project readable, maintainable, and adaptable by constantly looking for errors and ways that I could make it better.
